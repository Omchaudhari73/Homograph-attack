# Astra - HomographAttack


<h2><b>REMEMBER , THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY !</b></h2><br>

 IDN homograph attacks â€” a technique where attackers use lookalike characters to trick users into visiting fake websites.

# REQUIREMENT
1. Install python
2. clone this rbURL
3. run with command

```bash
python3 astra6.py
```

if there's error , u must install colorama first with this command
1. make sure u have add pip to environment variables
2. run this command 
```bash
pip install colorama
```

# Let me explain
For the example : <br>
human eyes see all URLs are the same, nothing suspicious or strange<br>
<b>But not with the computer</b><br>
example , human eyes see apple.com just like normal<br>
<b>But computer see there is a Cyrillic character inside 'apple' in 'a' letter<br>
if you type apple.com in browser , there is nothing happened , it's an official web of apple<br>
but if you type 'apple.com' with 'a' letter is change to Cyrillic character, it will shock you<br>
<b>apple.com is empty</b> because u use 'a' letter of Cyrillic to fake human eyes. <br>
<br>
That mean , you can buy that domain and <b>you can do something crazy like phising with another level</b><br>
 
in this case I'll use my tools to perform this attack and the target is apple.com<br>
